Building Haggle for Android
===========================

NOTE: Always check http://code.google.com/p/haggle/w/list for the
latest information on building for Android.

Haggle can be built for Google's Android OS (e.g., the Nexus One).
Android is Linux based, but it is a very stripped down system with a
minimal libc (called Bionic) and very basic C++ library support. There
are no STL classes available on Android, but Haggle is built by
default using its own STL-like container classes.

To build Haggle for Android, you need an Android toolchain (ARM
based). There are probably several ways to build Haggle for Android,
but here we assume you use the source tree that can be downloaded from
http://source.android.com. Follow the instructions on
http://source.android.com/download in order to build the Android
sources (you may want to build specifically for the G1 phone. Please
note the special procedure for that). We here assume you build for a
real device, and not the Android simulator.

Currently there is no support for building Haggle with the Android NDK
(Native Development Kit), although this should in theory be possible
(at least if one ignores the fact that we probably rely on some
headers that are not available in the NDK).

Once you have a completely built Android system, enter the top
directory of the Android source tree and put your Haggle source in
'external/haggle' (the easiest way is to just put a symlink there
pointing to wherever your Haggle source is located). Execute

> source build/envsetup.sh

In order to set all paths, etc. It might also be necessary to run the
normal Haggle configure process in order to generate the config.h
header file before Haggle can be built for Android.

Haggle depends on the presence of Bluetooth and WiFi support in the
Android build configuration. Make sure that the board configuration of
your Android configuration includes Bluetooth and WiFi
support. Support for such hardware is typically included when building
for a specific phone, such as Dream, Magic or Nexus One. But, when
building for, e.g., "generic" there is no such support in the
configuration. This can be added by creating a new configuration, or
editing an existing, and adding the following to BoardConfig.mk:

BOARD_HAVE_BLUETOOTH := true                                                                                                                        
BOARD_WLAN_TI_STA_DK_ROOT := system/wlan/ti/sta_dk_4_0_4_32     

For example, for the "generic" configuration the BoardConfig.mk is 
found at build/target/board/generic/BoardConfig.mk. Note that the 
path to the wlan source may change with newer Android source versions.
 
NOTE: Support for the Texas Instrument WiFi driver is only required
for phones such as HTC's Magic, G1, and Hero. This driver does not
support the Linux Wireless extensions and therefore require special
code to detect the wireless interface. The Google Nexus One natively
supports wireless extensions and therefore it can use the "regular"
Linux code for detecting interfaces.

When everything is setup, enter 'external/haggle' and type 'mm'. This
should build Haggle for Android. The binaries will end up as part of
the Android system in 'out/target/product/dream/system' (you might
have 'generic' instead of 'dream', depending on what target you built
for). You may manually transfer the binaries and libraries to your
Android device using, e.g., the 'adb push' command (or the provided
'install_haggle.sh' script), or you may create a new system image
(which now includes Haggle) and then flash your device with it. If you
want to compile against another target than 'generic', you may have to
run, e.g., 'lunch htc_dream-eng', or 'lunch generic_passion-eng' (for
Nexus One) to change target (as of version 0.3, Haggle is by default
configured to compile against phones with wireless extension support).

The basic components of Haggle that are of interest for Android are
the Haggle executable ('haggle') and the application programming
library ('libhaggle'). These end up in the output directory's 'bin/'
and 'lib/' folders, respectively. Since Android's libxml2 library does
not have the features needed by Haggle compiled in, a separate libxml2
is built for Haggle. This is renamed to 'haggle-libxml2' in order to
avoid conflicts and ends up in 'lib/'. In order to build applications
using Android's Java-based application framework, a JNI class library
is also built and installed. The components of this library are
'libhaggle_jni' (the native code) and haggle.jar (the class
library). These end up in 'lib/' and 'framework/',
respectively. Haggle applications can be developed by including the
haggle.jar class library when developing for Android.

Haggle can be run from a shell by logging in on the phone with 'adb'.
Type 'adb shell' to get a shell on the phone. Then execute 'haggle'.

(How to use 'adb' and install programs on your device is out of the
scope of this document, so we assume that you have the proper
access and permissions on your device.)

In order to install binaries in '/system', you may need to remount the
filesystem with read/write permissions:

> mount -o remount,rw -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system

Writing Haggle Applications
---------------------------

Haggle applications are developed as any other Android applications
(see the Android tutorials for that). However, to be able to interact
with Haggle from your application, you also have to include the
haggle.jar class library in your Android application project (e.g., in
Eclipse). The Haggle class library allows your application to interact
with Haggle using a Java API.

One example application, called "PhotoShare", should be bundled with
this source package in the 'android' directory. PhotoShare is an
Android Eclipse project. Once it is opened in Eclipse, it is probably
necessary to configure local paths to haggle.jar, the Android SDK,
etc.

Setting Ad hoc mode
-------------------

NOTE: This applies to phones with the TI wlan wireless chip (e.g., G1,
Magic, Hero). The Nexus One uses the Linux wireless extensions and
require the wireless tools to set ad hoc mode. These tools have to be
compiled separately.

At the time of writing of this document, Android has no GUI for
setting ad hoc mode on the WiFi interface. However, ad hoc mode can be
manually set through the shell by modifying the file
/system/etc/wifi/tiwlan.ini with the following settings.

WiFiAdhoc = 1
dot11DesiredSSID = HTCG1Default
dot11DesiredBSSType = 0 

The driver module has to be reloaded into the kernel using this new
configuration.

Alternatively, use the script 'adhoc.sh'. Install the script on the
device and run it as 'root', e.g.:

# ./adhoc.sh start [ #nodeNR ]

The WiFi interface should be turned off in the Android GUI before this
script is run.

Note about a bug with static initializers in Bionic
---------------------------------------------------

As of Android platform release 1.5r2 (and probably earlier) there is a
confirmed bug in Bionic which causes the constructor of static objects
to be run twice.

See the following discussion thread for more information:

http://groups.google.com/group/android-platform/browse_thread/thread/1a434b326cef6609

To deal with this problem, some class constructors, of which there
exist statically allocated objects, have extra checks to make sure the
constructor can handle two calls without bad consequences.  In some
other constructors, no fixes have been applied, because the problem is
not critical. For example, statically allocated strings will probably
leak memory because the string constructor is run twice, thus
allocating the string memory twice as well. But this is something one
can live with until a fix is applied in Bionic upstream.
